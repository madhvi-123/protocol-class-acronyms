# Protocol-Class Acronyms (PCA-1 Standard)

**PCA-1** defines a new class of Web3-native naming primitives:  
**Protocol-Class Acronyms** — acronymic assets that encode protocol identity, lore, and ownership in a modular format.

---

## ✦ What Is a PCA?

A **Protocol-Class Acronym** (PCA) is more than a domain.  
It’s a full-stack naming entity composed of:

- `.com` domain (Body)  
- GitHub-hosted lore file (Soul)  
- 1/1 NFT (Spirit) — the Genesis Glyph  

PCAs are minted, sealed, and transferred through **DreamBuilderDAO** — the protocol vault.

## ✦ Why It Exists

ENS made wallets readable.  
We make **protocols summonable**.

Instead of raw domains, PCA-1 defines **structured naming assets** that come with built-in story, provenance, and activation potential.

Use cases include:
- Foundational primitives (e.g. CRX = onchain reputation)
- DAO governance keys
- Narrative-bound protocol auctions
- Symbolic protocol licensing
