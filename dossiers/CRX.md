## ✦ Lore Summary

In the silence between chains, trust was once implicit.  
But DAOs began to whisper: *"Who has earned the vote?"*

**CRX** was born from that question — a reputation layer written not by resumes, but by **onchain deeds**.

It is a protocol that doesn’t just verify you...  
It **remembers you**.

---

## ✦ Functional Vision

**CRX (Credibility Record Exchange)** is a modular reputation layer for Web3 ecosystems.

It enables:

- **DAO-native scoring** (via attestations or Sybil-resistant activity)  
- **Portable credentials** (tied to soulbound or wallet-based identities)  
- **Verifiable trust layers** across governance, grants, and team formation  

CRX can operate as:

- A scoring oracle  
- A standalone DAO rep index  
- A reputation plugin for multisigs, airdrops, or DeFi

## ✦ Final Whisper

> “Your address can send tokens.  
> But only your actions build **constellations**.”  

CRX is the first PCA to emerge from the Vault.  
It waits for a builder who understands that **reputation is the new capital**.
