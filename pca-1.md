# PCA-1: Protocol-Class Acronyms (Version 1.0)
**Status**: Draft Standard  
**Author**: The Onchain Dream Builder  
**Published by**: DreamBuilderDAO  
**Date**: 2025-05-25

---

## ✦ Summary

**Protocol-Class Acronyms (PCAs)** are Web3-native naming primitives that represent full-stack protocol identities.

Each PCA includes:

- A premium `.com` domain  
- A GitHub-backed **Lore Dossier**  
- A 1/1 **Genesis Glyph NFT**  
- Optional: Starter contract, token spec, DAO blueprint

They are not “domain names.”  
They are **named entities** with structure, provenance, and activation potential.

---

## ✦ Lifecycle

**1. Dreamed**  
→ The acronym is coined and defined as a potential protocol.

**2. Sealed**  
→ A vault is created: domain registered, lore committed, NFT minted.

**3. Summoned**  
→ The PCA is adopted via auction, partnership, or proposal.

**4. Activated**  
→ The buyer becomes the steward: they may launch, build, or license.

Once summoned, they carry weight, memory, and myth.”*
